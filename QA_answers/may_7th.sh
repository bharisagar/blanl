scalability :refers to the ability of a system to handle an increasing amount of work, or its potential to accommodate growth. In AWS, scalability is achieved through services like Auto Scaling, Elastic Load Balancing, and managed databases that can scale up or down based on demand.
horizontal scaling :involves adding more machines or instances to a system to handle increased load. In AWS, this can be achieved by launching additional EC2 instances or using services like Amazon ECS or EKS to distribute workloads across multiple containers or nodes.
vertical scaling :involves increasing the resources (CPU, memory, storage) of an existing machine or instance. In AWS, this can be done by resizing EC2 instances or upgrading RDS instances to larger instance types.
#example:
#!/bin/bash
#!/bin/bash
# This script demonstrates horizontal and vertical scaling in AWS using EC2 instances.
# Horizontal scaling: Launching multiple EC2 instances
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-12345678 --count 3 --instance-type t2.micro --key-name MyKeyPair --security-group-ids sg-12345678 --subnet-id subnet-12345678
# Vertical scaling: Resizing an existing EC2 instance  
aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id i-12345678 --instance-type t2.medium
# Note: Replace ami-12345678, sg-12345678, subnet-12345678, and i-12345678 with your actual values.

aws load balance :refers to the distribution of incoming network traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, or IP addresses. 
AWS provides Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) services that automatically distribute incoming application traffic and scale resources to meet demand.
# ELB helps ensure high availability and fault tolerance by routing traffic to healthy targets and can handle sudden spikes in traffic.
# There are three types of load balancers in AWS: Application Load Balancer (ALB), Network Load Balancer (NLB), and Classic Load Balancer.
# Each type is designed for different use cases and provides various features to optimize application performance and security.
# Example of creating an Application Load Balancer using AWS CLI:  
#!/bin/bash
# This script demonstrates how to create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in AWS using the AWS CLI.
# Note: Make sure you have the AWS CLI installed and configured with the necessary permissions.
# Create a security group for the ALB
aws ec2 create-security-group --group-name my-alb-sg --description "Security group for ALB"
# Get the security group ID
SECURITY_GROUP_ID=$(aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-names my-alb-sg --query "SecurityGroups[0].GroupId" --output text)
# Create the ALB
aws elbv2 create-load-balancer --name my-alb --subnets subnet-12345678 subnet-23456789 --security-groups $SECURITY_GROUP_ID --scheme internet-facing
# Note: Replace subnet-12345678 and subnet-23456789 with your actual subnet IDs.

# AWS Load Balancer is a service that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, or IP addresses. It helps ensure high availability and fault tolerance by routing traffic to healthy targets and can handle sudden spikes in traffic.  
#There are three types of load balancers in AWS:
# 1. Application Load Balancer (ALB): Best suited for HTTP and HTTPS traffic, it operates at the application layer (Layer 7) and provides advanced routing features, such as host-based and path-based routing, SSL termination, and WebSocket support.
# 2. Network Load Balancer (NLB): Designed for TCP and UDP traffic, it operates at the transport layer (Layer 4) and is capable of handling millions of requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latencies. NLB is suitable for applications that require extreme performance and static IP addresses.
# 3. Classic Load Balancer: This is the original load balancer that operates at both Layer 4 and Layer 7. It is suitable for applications built within the EC2-Classic network and provides basic load balancing features.
# However, AWS recommends using ALB or NLB for new applications due to their advanced features and better performance.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
why we use load balancer in aws:
# 1. High Availability: Load balancers distribute incoming traffic across multiple targets, ensuring that if one target becomes unhealthy or fails,
 the load balancer can route traffic to healthy targets, maintaining application availability.   
# 2. Scalability: Load balancers can automatically scale to handle varying levels of traffic, allowing applications to accommodate sudden spikes in demand without manual intervention.
# 3. Fault Tolerance: By routing traffic to healthy targets, load balancers help prevent downtime and ensure that users can access the application even if some targets are unavailable.
